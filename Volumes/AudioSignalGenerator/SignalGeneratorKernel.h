Abstract:
The processing kernel manages the state of the signal generator. It is a C++ class that is safe to use in a real-time render block.
 
IMPORTANT: To mitigate aliasing, the sample generates sawtooth, square, and triangle waveforms after their Fourier series. Although not efficient, this approach ensures the waveforms are band-limited, and produces the maximum number of harmonics with frequencies bound by the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate).
